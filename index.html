      <h1>Joint statement accompanying image</h1>
      <p>The parties to this statement are ACT Corrective Services and Detainee A, an Aboriginal man, who made a complaint about it.</p>
      <p>On 29 May 2018, the accompanying image was drawn on a whiteboard in a room regularly used by custodial staff. The name of the person depicted has been redacted. It is known that he is Aboriginal, and a person detained at the Alexander Maconochie Centre at that time. It was not possible to identify who drew the image. The existence of the image was made known to Detainee A when he overheard staff talk about it. He has stated that he has suffered significant emotional and psychological harm as a result. In proceedings that were instituted, a settlement was reached which contained practical outcomes for Detainee A to assist in his recovery.</p>
      <p>A letter of apology was also given to Detainee A.</p>
